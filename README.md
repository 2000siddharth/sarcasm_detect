# Sarcasm detection using Machine Learning and State of the Art Deep learning models

## 1. **Word2Vector, EDA, ML**
This notebook consists of bi-gram, tri-gram analysis of the Sarcasm Dataset
It also contains Word2Vec being used a vectorizer.
I have used 2 traditional NLP methods for classification:
1. Naive Bayes
2. Logistic Regression

## 2. **BERT Transformer**

This notebook is a simple and intuitive explanation of the BERT algorithm - *Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers*.
I have implemented it using the HuggingFace Transformer library.
I have also given an explanation of all steps in detail.
